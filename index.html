    <h2>📜 A Brief History of Computing</h2>
    
    <article>
        <h3>1. Conceptual Beginnings</h3>
        <p>The concept of computing predates electronic devices by centuries, with early tools like the **abacus** (c. 2700 BCE) serving as the first known calculating devices. The modern concept of a computer began in the 19th century with **Charles Babbage**, often called the "Father of Modern Computing." He designed the **Analytical Engine** (1830s), which was the conceptual blueprint for a general-purpose mechanical computer, featuring an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), memory, and a control unit—all core components of today's machines. Though never fully built in his lifetime, Babbage's work laid the theoretical groundwork.</p>

        <h3>2. The First Electronic Age: Vacuum Tubes</h3>
        <p>The true emergence of the computer as we know it came during the 1940s. Driven by the demands of World War II, the first electronic digital computers were developed. The **ENIAC** (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), completed in 1945, is often cited as the first general-purpose electronic computer. These first-generation machines were enormous, filling entire rooms, and used thousands of delicate, heat-generating **vacuum tubes** for their circuitry and memory. While revolutionary for their speed, they were expensive, unreliable, and consumed massive amounts of power.</p>

        <h3>3. Miniaturization and Commercialization</h3>
        <p>The second and third generations of computers brought dramatic reductions in size, cost, and power consumption. The invention of the **transistor** in the late 1940s replaced the bulky vacuum tubes, leading to smaller, faster, and more reliable second-generation machines. The next major leap was the **Integrated Circuit (IC)** in the 1960s, which packed thousands of transistors onto a single silicon chip. These third-generation computers, like the IBM System/360, became practical for businesses and universities, marking a transition to widespread commercial use.</p>

        <h3>4. The Personal Computer Revolution</h3>
        <p>The critical breakthrough that enabled the personal computer (PC) was the invention of the **microprocessor**—a Central Processing Unit (CPU) on a single chip—in the early 1970s. This innovation drastically reduced the cost and size of computing, birthing the fourth generation. The PC revolution truly began in 1977 with the mass-produced, preassembled machines like the **Apple II**, the Commodore PET, and the Tandy Radio Shack TRS-80.</p>

        <h3>5. Standardization and the Graphical Interface</h3>
        <p>The PC market was solidified with the 1981 introduction of the **IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC)**, running Microsoft's MS-DOS. The user experience was transformed in 1984 with the introduction of the **Apple Macintosh**, which popularized the **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**—using windows, icons, and a mouse instead of text commands. Microsoft followed this trend with the release of **Windows 1.0** in 1985, making computers far more intuitive and accessible to the general public.</p>

        <h3>6. The Modern Era and Global Connectivity</h3>
        <p>From the 1990s onward, computing entered its modern era, characterized by continued advancements in microprocessor power and the rise of portable devices like laptops and smartphones. The most impactful development was the commercialization of the **Internet**, turning the PC into a vital communication and information access tool, profoundly changing how people live, work, and interact globally.</p>

    <h2>⚙️ How a Computer Operates: The Core Loop</h2>
    <p>At its core, any digital computer operates on a fundamental loop known as the **Input-Process-Output-Storage** model. This cycle is essential to all computation.</p>
    
    <ol class="core-loop-steps">
        <li>
            <strong>Input:</strong> Data and instructions are received from input devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse, microphone).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Processing:</strong> The **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**, the computer's "brain," executes the program instructions. It uses its **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** to perform calculations and logical operations, coordinated by the **Control Unit**. Instructions and data are temporarily held in **Random Access Memory (RAM)** for fast access during this stage.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Output:</strong> The processed information (results) is displayed or transmitted via output devices (e.g., monitor, speaker, printer).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Storage:</strong> Data that needs to be kept permanently is written to a storage device (e.g., Hard Disk Drive or Solid State Drive).
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="os-note">The entire process is managed by the **Operating System (OS)**, the core software (like Windows or macOS) that controls the hardware and allows application programs to run.</p>
